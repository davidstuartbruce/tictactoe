# tictactoe
Qt based tic tac toe
This is largely taken from an example in "Game Programming Using Qt5
Beginner's Guide ,Second Edition" by Strakhov et al, with some
additional extension to support both human and computer ("AI")
players.  The logic employed for the computer player is the
minimax algorithm, adapted from a project elsewhere on
Github (https://github.com/ahmadabdolsaheb/minimaxarticle),
though here implemented in C++.

Note - though this is just a toy program and I hope no one would
get too worked up about copyright, you probably need to own the above book
to have fully legit access to the code taken straight from their example. 
But anyonecan do anything they want with the "AI" files I wrote from scratch
(tictactoebot.h and tictactoebot.cpp).

I mainly created this repository to familiarize myself with Github, and this
was a project I happened to have sitting on my computer.
