# tictactoe
Qt based tic tac toe
This is largely taken from an example in "Game Programming Using Qt5
Beginner's Guide ,Second Edition" by Strakhov et al, with some
additional extension to support both human and computer ("AI")
players.  The logic employed for the computer player is the
minimax algorithm, adapted from a project elsewhere on
Github (https://github.com/ahmadabdolsaheb/minimaxarticle),
though here implemented in C++.
